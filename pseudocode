- Add hover attribute to each tile
- Add user button to remove old + add new grid
- Make grid size be user width squared.
- Make user button adapt min-width/height to 100 
divided by grid width % (min-width: 100/[#]%;).

- Add resetGrid function, which removes all children tiles and
asks the user how big the new grid should be.
- If the response isn't a number or is above 100, re-do
the alert asking for a number from 1-100.

- Make gridHouse background black
- Make each tile white with 1 opacity
- Each mouseOver increases opacity (transparency) by 10%,
meaning background black color will be fully visible after 10 passes.
